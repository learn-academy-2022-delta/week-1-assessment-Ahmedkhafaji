// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
// const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
//  console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer: indigo will be pushed into colors making the value number of the array 5.
// b) Verify and explain: 5 is wha i got after verifying which is correct now there are 5 vales in the array when the indigo is added.


// --------------------1) What will this log?

// const cohort = "LEARN 2022"
//  console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: the answer would be the length of the cohort which is 9
// b) Verify and explain: i got back 10 which most likely the space was also counted making the length 10 


// --------------------2) What will this log?
 
// const greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[4])

// a) Your answer: greeting is the variable for hello world, i will most likely get hello world in my terminal 
// b) Verify and explain: the answer is the letter o because the value 4 is the o value. something  I totally ignored.


// --------------------3) What will this log?

// const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
// const index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: index will be placed at the begining of the array. 
// b) Verify and explain: I got ruby only in the terminal, I suppose the value 1 is "rubby" which is the only explaination. 


// --------------------4) What will this log?

// const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: string will be written in uppercase 
// b) Verify and explain: could not verify becuase output says;weekDays.toUpperCase is not a function. I tried to fix the code but couldnt find out. I think the output after fixing the code to captilize the string. 


// --------------------5) What will this log?

const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: the output would give a value of 3 
// b) Verify and explain: the output was the word number. I did not understand this output but I think i got "number" becuase a type of length would only make sense for "number" because a string is not a type of length and same thing goes for boolean.
