## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: 
just like how vairable can be assigned to a string or an array. high order function that can be given a paramter and to return a function. 

2. Jest: jest is a better way to unit test instead of run on the frontend becuase it would be harder to do. 

3. Objects: just like how regular objects have properties, js objects also have properties to define its characteristics. 

4. Method: js property have methods thats contain a function definition. so methods are functions stored as object properties. 

5. Classes: template for creating objects. contains data with code to work on the data.
